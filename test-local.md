# Local Testing Guide

## âœ… **What's Working Locally**

### 1. **Development Server** - Port 8080
- âœ… Server running at http://localhost:8080
- âœ… Hot reload working
- âœ… All dependencies installed

### 2. **Production Build** - Port 3000
- âœ… Build successful (`npm run build`)
- âœ… Production server running at http://localhost:3000
- âœ… All assets properly bundled
- âœ… `_redirects` file copied to dist folder

### 3. **Environment Configuration**
- âœ… Supabase credentials configured
- âœ… Environment variables working
- âœ… Production URL detection working

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Checklist**

### **Core Functionality**
- [ ] **Authentication**: Sign up/login works
- [ ] **Organization Management**: Create/edit/delete organizations
- [ ] **Calendar View**: Calendar displays correctly
- [ ] **Post Management**: Create/edit/delete posts
- [ ] **Media Upload**: Image uploads work

### **Sharing Features** (Critical for Production)
- [ ] **Generate Share Links**: View-only and edit access
- [ ] **Share Link Access**: Links work when accessed directly
- [ ] **Token Validation**: Supabase Edge Function integration
- [ ] **Access Control**: View vs edit permissions work

### **Production Readiness**
- [ ] **Build Process**: `npm run build` completes successfully
- [ ] **Static Files**: All assets properly generated
- [ ] **Routing**: SPA routing works in production build
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Production config loads correctly

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps for Netlify Deployment**

1. **Push to Git Repository**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Netlify deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**
   - Connect repository in Netlify dashboard
   - Set environment variables:
     - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
     - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - Deploy automatically

3. **Test Production Features**
   - Verify sharing links work with production domain
   - Test organization management in production
   - Confirm all functionality works as expected

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting**

### **If Build Fails**
- Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Check for TypeScript compilation errors

### **If Sharing Doesn't Work**
- Verify Supabase Edge Functions are deployed
- Check CORS configuration in Supabase
- Ensure environment variables are set correctly

### **If Organizations Can't Be Created**
- Check Supabase RLS policies
- Verify user authentication is working
- Check database migrations are applied

## ðŸ“± **Testing URLs**

- **Development**: http://localhost:8080
- **Production Build**: http://localhost:3000
- **Netlify**: https://your-site.netlify.app (after deployment)

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Criteria**

Your project is ready for Netlify deployment when:
- âœ… Local development server works
- âœ… Production build completes successfully
- âœ… All core features work locally
- âœ… Sharing functionality tested
- âœ… Organization management tested
- âœ… Environment configuration verified
